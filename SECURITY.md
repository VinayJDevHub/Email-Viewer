🔐 Security Measures – Secure Email Document Listing App
This document outlines the security mechanisms implemented to ensure user data, email contents, and attachments are protected throughout the application workflow.

1. 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
✅ Google OAuth 2.0
The app uses Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.

Secure and scoped access is requested using:

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email

Only read-only permissions are granted — no email modifications are allowed.

✅ Token Security
OAuth tokens (access & refresh) are securely stored in MongoDB.

Tokens are automatically refreshed using the Google OAuth flow.

Tokens are not exposed to the frontend or third-party services.

✅ Route Protection
All FastAPI routes related to user data (e.g., email listing, attachment download) are protected using Depends(get_current_user).

Only authenticated users can access their own data.

2. 📁 Secure Attachment Handling
✅ Temp File Strategy
Attachments are decoded and stored temporarily in OS-secure temp directories.

They are served via FileResponse with appropriate media_type headers.

Files are not publicly accessible or stored long-term.

✅ Direct Download (No Redirection)
Attachments are served as direct downloads to prevent redirection or exposure of sensitive URLs.

3. 🔒 MongoDB Security
MongoDB Atlas connection uses TLS/SSL encryption.

Database access is restricted via IP whitelisting and username/password authentication.

Sensitive keys (Mongo URI, secret keys) are never hardcoded — they are loaded via environment variables (.env file).

4. 📧 Email Scope Control
Gmail API scopes are kept minimal and read-only to reduce risk:

No ability to send, delete, or modify emails.

Emails are fetched only when user is authenticated and consent is provided.

5. 🛡️ Additional Protections
Feature	Protection Used
Secrets & Tokens	.env file + python-dotenv
API Protection	FastAPI dependency injection (Depends)
Email Fetching	Gmail API + OAuth + Token Refresh
Frontend Access Control	Session-based login flow

🚫 What We Avoided
No session data is stored in browser cookies.

No user credentials (email/password) are handled manually — only OAuth-based login.

No third-party access or analytics integration that could leak data.

✅ Summary
Area	Security Applied
Authentication	Google OAuth2 with scope restriction
Token Handling	Stored securely, refreshed automatically
Route Access	Depends-based FastAPI protections
Data Storage	Encrypted MongoDB + no hardcoded credentials
Attachments	Temp files + download-only access
